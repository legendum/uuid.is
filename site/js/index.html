          <h1>Storing private data securely and anonymously</h1>
          <p>May 3rd, 2014</p>

          <h3>What?</h3>
          <p>We offer private data storage that's both secure and anonymous by using modern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software">open-source</a> technologies. We intentionally store as little information as possible (no personal details, usernames, etc) and encrypt everything. This means it's virtually impossible for anyone except you to read your data (unless you intentionally share it).</p>

          <h3>Why?</h3>
          <p>Edward Snowden's <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/series/the-snowden-files">revelations</a> about global online surveillance have shown that it's very hard to store data privately and/or anonymously. Most internet companies are able to read the data you store with them, and track what you do online. We offer an alternative.</p>

          <h3>Who?</h3>
          <p>The <a href="https://uuids.net">uuids.net</a> service is owned and operated by Kevin Hutchinson and associates. Contact <a href="https://twitter.com/uuids">@uuids</a> for more information. (The service is called UUIDs because it uses <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier">UUIDs</a> to anonymously manage private data.)</p>

          <h3>Where?</h3>
          <p>All data enters and exits our systems via Iceland, where it's securely encrypted before storage in back-ends around the world. Iceland has <a href="https://immi.is/">special laws</a> protecting freedom of information and anonymous internet use. The data stored in the back-ends is unreadable because it has been securely encrypted in Iceland.</p>

          <h3>When?</h3>
          <p>We'll complete testing through June 2014, then release our beta service in July 2014. Return to this page to begin using the service when it's ready.</p>
